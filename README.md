This application is a simpel example of how designers/product managers can create a clickable prototype for engineering teams.

## What does the app can do?

* [x] Required: Navigate through a bunch of screens.

## What did I miss?

This is kind of a beta version. Some of the screen transitions don't match the spec and the splash screen isn't working.
